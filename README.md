# medintel-dump — a note from Whitecoat

If you found this, I don’t have much time.

They’re watching. I had to split the proof — couldn’t risk a single place holding everything.  
I left fragments. You’ll need to put them back together.

This repo contains pieces. I’m giving you the map: there are six phases and they must be followed in order.

**Order:** Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 6

I can’t say more here. If you’re careful, you’ll see why I hid things the way I did.  
If you’re loud, you’ll get their attention — and that’s the last thing I want.
